Description:
------------------------------------------

Fast TEAPOT is the first application of the UAL Accelerator Propagator Framework (APF) 
introducing a uniform mechanism for development and assembly of diverse accelerator 
simulation approaches. Fast TEAPOT is built as a UAL local (application-oriented) 
extension based on the combination of sector linear matricies and TEAPOT symplectic 
integrators. 

The source code is located in the ./src directory and includes the following components:

- evolver           : main program for producing two Taylor maps, teapot.map 
                      and fast_teapot.map, based on the element-by-element and 
                      matrix-quad-matrix (fast TEAPOT) approaches respectively
- tracker           : main program for tracking a bunch of particles based on 
                      the element-by-element and matrix-quad-matrix (fast TEAPOT) 
                      approaches.

Usage:
------------------------------------------

make
cd linux
./evolver
./tracker

Structure:
------------------------------------------

rhic.pl - Perl script calculating chromaticity and the second order Taylor maps
	  based on the TEAPOT element-by-element approach. 
./data/blue - dAu-top-swn-no_sexts.sxf - RHIC SXF file with a linear lattice
./out/rhic  - output files produced by rhic.pl
./src       - source directory with the FastTEAPOT builder, evolver, and tracker
./linux     - directory with the evolver (generating two Taylor maps, teapot.map 
              and fast_teapot.map) and tracker (propagating a bunch of particles).
