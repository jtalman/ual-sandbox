                      targeting the standard bunch, one turn, and Twiss seem to pass the "smoke test".

                      This code should be static ie should be "near working" in the future.

                         runExampleFor_orbitsWithSpin
                      eventually targeting multiple turns with spin seem to pass the "smoke test".

                      This code is no longer anticipated as the leading edge of the research and development
                      effort, hence will be substantially static.
