a0x, b0x:
   Running
      ./tracker ./data/E_BM_M1.0.sxf 40 -1 > ! OUT_m=-1.00
   (skipping the careful clean, and slightly modified to not redirect std::cerr) from the
      sxfAnalysisExample_m=-1.00
   instructions file gives
      RMT: a0x 3.96957e-09 b0x 58.1868 mu_xTent 5.66973 a0y 6.62176e-12 b0y 45.3526 mu_yTent 1.04014

   This allows a0x, 3.96957e-09, and b0x, 58.1868, to be used subsequently.

   Alternatively, one can have these values available from some other source, e.g.
      out/STT/TWISS_m=-1.00

   I don't thing alpha, beta, and, gamma, are being handled consistently between these programs at this point (7/30/2012)

Populate the Standard Particle files:
   out/TWISS/StndrdPrtcl...

   Follow instructions sequentially in file
      determineTwissExample_m=-1.00
   The "gnuplots" are probably the best verification that the standard bunch is being handled reasonably correctly.

Transfer Matrix:
   Running
      ./transferMatrix -1.00 300 3.96957e-09 58.1868
   gives the evolved transfer matrix, M (M00, M01, ..., M55), for m=-1 at the 300th lattice element (including drifts).

   Running
      ./det
         6
         M00 M01 ... M05
         M10 ...
         ...
         M50 ... M55
   verifies that the evolved transfer matrix has a determinant of 1 and gives its inverse.

   det can be compiled with
      gcc det.c -o det -lm
