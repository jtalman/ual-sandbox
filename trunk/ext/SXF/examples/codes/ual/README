Usage:

1. RHIC 

>perl rhic2sxf.pl 
--- initializes SMF data structures from RHIC data (UAL/data/RHIC/rf directory)
--- prints first turn track output (./out/firstturn/rhic.all) 
--- prepares a SXF output file (./in/rhic.sxf)

>perl sxf2rhic.pl 
--- parses a SXF input file (./in/rhic.sxf) and prints an echo file (./echo/rhic.sxf)
--- prints first turn track output (./out/firstturn/rhic.sxf) 
--- prepares a SXF otput file (./out/rhic.sxf)

2. LHC

>perl sxf2lhc.pl 
--- parses a SXF input file (./in/lhc.v5.0.sxf) and prints an echo file
--- prints first turn track output (./out/8/lhc.v5.0.sxf) 
--- prepares a SXF otput file (./out/lhc.v5.0.sxf)

The directory ./out/8 contains several files that illustrate some differences
between TEAPOT and MAD algorithms:

1. TEAPOT++.  

lhc.v5.0.T_00  (on-momentum) and lhc.v5.0.T_DE (off-momentum)

2. TEAPOT++ with the MAD linear drift approximation:

lhc.v5.0.TM_00 (on-momentum) and lhc.v5.0.TM_DE (off-momentum)

3. MAD 8.

lhc.v5.0.M_00  (on-momentum) and lhc.v5.0.M_DE  (off-momentum)
