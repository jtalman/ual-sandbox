Pre Build:
   make clean
   make external

   Output:
      ./lib/linux/obj/driftOrDefault.o
      ./lib/linux/obj/positionPrinter.o
      ./lib/linux/obj/rfCavity.o
      ./lib/linux/obj/timer.o

Build:
   make

   Output:
      ./lib/linux/obj/bendAndMultipole.o
      ./lib/linux/obj/fourVector.o
      ./lib/linux/obj/threeVector.o
      ./lib/linux/obj/tracker.o

      ./tracker

   Notes:
      The external build step identifies the files external to THINSPIN, but included
      so that it is self contained. make, alone, is sufficient. Furthemore, fourVector
      and threeVector are likely to be static as well.

      Class fourTensor (likely to be static) is compiled via its included header, so
      any changes to it need to be explicitly compiled in.

      It is pretty quick to type make clean, then make at each change.


Run:
   ./tracker

   Notes:
      Environmental variables provide some configurability, e.g.
         setenv GSL_RNG_TYPE "taus"
         setenv GSL_RNG_SEED 123


Output:
   ./out/cpp/muon0.13_R5m.map1
   ./out/cpp/muon0.13_R5m.orbit
   ./out/cpp/muon0.13_R5m.sxf
   ./out/cpp/muon0.13_R5m.twiss

   stdout
   stderr

Notes:
   tracker implicitly uses
      ./data/thinspin.apdf
      ./data/muon0.13_R5m.sxf

   The current sxf file, muon0.13_R5m.sxf, doesn't require the external
   element/propagator/evolver files

   The current apdf file, thinspin.apdf, specifies algorithms, but seems
   incomplete/irrelevant?
