                      The line by line instructions in
                         determineTwissCleanRunPlotM1.0_sl4
                      targeting the standard bunch, one turn, and Twiss seem to pass the "smoke test".

                      This code should be static ie should be "near working" in the future.

                      The line by line instructions in
                         runExampleFor_orbitsWithSpin
                      eventually targeting multiple turns with spin seem to pass the "smoke test".

                      This code is no longer anticipated as the leading edge of the research and development
                      effort, hence will be substantially static.

                      There is now a directory
                         statusAndRegression
                      that has various potentially relevant documents. This includes
                         stateOfETEAPOT.pdf
                      which might be of special assistance. It is a (status summary)/overview of UAL/ETEAPOT.
