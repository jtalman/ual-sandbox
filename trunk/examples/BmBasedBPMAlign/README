Description:
------------

Example shows how to extends (personalize) shell for the beam-based
alignment application. The physics of this example concerns itself
with a family of quadrupoles, each equipped with a steering elements
(kicker), and a BPM. The task is to center the beam horizontally
at each of the (imperfectly aligned) quadrupoles. This example is 
based on an actual study of beam-based alignment of quadrupoles 
in the SNS and is discussed in detail in the technical note 
./doc/TechNote116.pdf .

Usage:
------

perl BmBasedBPMAlign.pl
