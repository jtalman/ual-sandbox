   1) What a ROOT version of a UAL script may look like. (demo.cc)
      The shell used for this demo is is ual/ext/ROOT and is made 
      automatically if ROOT is properly installed.

  To run in ROOT do:
 root [0] gSystem->Load("$(UAL_EXTRA)/ROOT/lib/linux/libUalRoot.so")      --- load UalRoot library. 
         **** Above step is only needed if above line
	 **** In NOT in rootlogon.C file
 root [1] .L demo.cc           --- load scripts.  These are interperted.
 root [2] run()                --- runs the script.
 <hopefully good output here :-)

  This procedure is identical for aperture_demo.cc


  Any ROOT script is essentially a  C++ program.
  To make a UAL C++ program into a ROOT script.
  1) Load all of the libraries (can be done in the script if needed) as shown above.
  2) rename main to something else.
  3) remove all includes EXCEPT for STL related includes.
  4) BE CAREFUL WITH STL and templates in general.  CINT does not interpret templates
     very well, this includes STL.  vector's and lists are the most well supported.  STL and
     template use is fine in compiled code, but this is interpreted!
  5) the std namespace is in global scope in CINT.
  6) multiple functions can be contained in a single script file.
  7) in the ROOT Users Guide theses are called MACROS.


 When using classes in ROOT the following should be noted:
   0) Class needs to be compiled with Dictionary (see makefile).
   1) once the Class.so library is loaded, the #include<Class.hh> statement is not needed.
      It is possible to have ROOT automatically load these classes when it starts. (may include example later).
   2) If the class is a template class, only the templates that are defined in the LinkDef
      file are availible in the CINT interpreter. (may include example later)
   3) Otherwise, inside of CINT, the class behaves like normal.

   
   Additional information including the comprehensive User Guide and  a variety of featuring
   examples can be downloaded from the ROOT site: http://root.cern.ch.
